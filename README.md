# Calculator Web App

This is my first full html, css, and javascript web app that I have taken from start to finish.

I did not spend a significant time testing edge cases for bugs, but the basic functions of it works to my satisfaction.

This project was more about gaining experience in taking a web app from start to finish, rather than building a calculator with perfect logic.

Given the time that I spent on this (~1 full day), I am very happy with the results.

Thanks for checking this out!
